The Valley of Minimal Effort
==============================
This terrain is a deeply thought out metaphore that representing my mental state as a grad student who is also working full time. The dense forestry represents my free time, and the great lake represents my sanity.
The houses represent the people who I regularly socialize with, and the lush, green grass represnts my physical health.
